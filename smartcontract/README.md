Soroban smart contracts powering JointSave on the Stellar network.

## Contracts

| Contract | Description |
|---|---|
| `factory` | Registry for all deployed JointSave pools |
| `rotational` | Rotational savings pool – members take turns receiving payouts |
| `target` | Goal-based savings pool – funds unlock when target is reached |
| `flexible` | Flexible deposit/withdraw pool with optional yield distribution |

## Prerequisites

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Build
